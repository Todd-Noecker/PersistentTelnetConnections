# PersistentTelnetConnections
The goal of this C project was to create two daemons. A server and client for reestablishing a telnet connection and buffering all data.

Learning Outcomes:
Successfully reestablish a TCP/IP connection using sproxy and cproxy daemons after a connection has been broken by changing IP addresses of the client.
Buffer all data being sent back from sproxy so that if a connection is lost all data is still delivered.
